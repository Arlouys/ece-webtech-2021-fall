# Lab

Create a basic app with three routes:

- `/` explains how `/hello` works
- `/hello` takes a `name` query parameter and
  - random names replies `hello [name]`
  - your own name replies with a short intro of yourself
  - any other replies a 404 code with a not found message

You should have an `index.js` file with the server creation and `handles.js` defining the server's callback

Add a `package.json` file with you module declaration

Add a `readme.md` file with title, introduction, run instructions and your name
